This release of GoMule is in test stadium, 
do not use this program without backup your D2 characters !!!

Basically the read/write character "core" is setup by Gohanman,
For now I have only changed the looks a bit.

It's not perfect (far from actually), but for now it is enough 
to start testing this release of GoMule.

What it can do:
- opening / saving characters
- opening / saving / creating ATMA stashes
- autosave with closing characters / stashes / application (allways)
- moving items from one character / stash to another
- Creating Flavie style reports

How to move an item:
- it is NOT Drag & Drop style like atma !!!

- Open one (or multiple) characters
- move the mouse cursor to an item. (NOTE: the cursur be a hand cursor)
- click the item you want (or multiple) to move (press and release mouse button 1)
-    the to be moving item(s) appears in the "current item" window
-    the item should be removed from the oriniginal spot
-    the orininigal file get's a * in the title (modified)
- move the mouse cursor the new/drop spot. (NOTE: the cursur should be a crosshair cursor)
- click on the position where you want to move the item to
-    the item should be removed from the clipboard to the new spot. 
-    the new file get's a * (modified)
- Click the SaveAll button or just close the application to save the changes.
- The clipboard is also implemented as a stash and is saved with the saveAll / closing application


This is a very very basic version, it lacks a lot of features. ( Which I will start working on )
But for now it is enough to test if the oriniginal loading/saving 
of characters works.
