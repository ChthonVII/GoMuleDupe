#GoMuleDupe

A fork of GoMule for D2R with support for duping items. (Also fixes a serious bug that might lead to data corruption.)

#Why?
Because I have better things to do with my time than endlessly farm for high runes.

Be warned, however, that overuse of the dupe feature may short circuit your enjoyment of the game by depriving you of the feeling that something worthwhile remains unfound and *might* drop for you this game. Use it judiciously.

#How?
Two new buttons have been added to .d2x stashes. Click "Pickup Dupe" to pick up a duplicate copy of the selected item(s) to the clipboard while leaving original in the stash. The duplicate copy will be given a new randomized fingerprint. Click "Drop Dupe" to drop a duplicate copy of the selected item(s) into the stash while leaving the original in the clipboard. The duplicate copy will be given a new randomized fingerprint.

Also good to know: GoMule uses Swing, so hi-dpi support can be accomplished with one of the following syntaxes:
>java -Dsun.java2d.uiScale=2 -jar GoMule.jar

>java -Dsun.java2d.uiScale=300% -jar GoMule.jar
