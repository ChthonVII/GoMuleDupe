GOMULE

Major rewrite of the item property classes. They now:
-use the diablo game files more.
-applies transformations to items correctly and cleanly.
-does things in an appropriate class rather than the item class.
-fixed numerous display bugs.


Added to the main GUI
-Added new functionality
-Improved error handling
-Added more user friendly messages

Partially refactored a large number of classes.

Fixed so many bugs I can't remember most of them:
-Fixed level reqs for set items
-Fixed level reqs for rare items
-Fixed backup dates
-Fixed problem where certain file parameters could lead to crash on character load
-Fixed rare items being classed as crafted
-Fixed item filter on stash (so many damn times. Regex....)
-Fixed GUID problems with charms
-Fixed multiple problems with MACS (DAMN YOU MAC USERS!)
-Fixed problems with some runewords


DROPCALC

Fixed bug with multiple items in a single type (eg tyraels + templars)
Fixed bugs with MF (diminishing returns not correct, rounding errors everywhere!)
Fixed problems with certain monsters and their TCs
Fixed various bugs leading to errors
Added new kills column thanks to the help of the community (Oscuro for the patch, RTB for the original idea and Anaesthesia for the math)


FLAVIE

Fixed the damn rainbow facet in flavie bug!!!!!!


...And much more that I've forgotten.


One thing I noticed in text dumps of Donkey was there are several line breaks sometimes not just one. See attached.
>FIXED APART FROM SET ITEMS;

When you pick something up to the clipboard and move the cursor over to the drop all window the popup/mouse over info comes up instantly. This obscures the drop button. The one which should be on the stash window. *cough*
Anyway, you need to increase the delay or move the buttons down, because it's bloody annoying.

//	Props such as +skills can appear twice, prop nums: 107,97,188,201,198,204 should be ignored

WEAPON DAMAGE FOR 2H storage etc.

- I like text dumps, they are very useful for trading, reviewing offline etc. So text dumps for stashes too please. And a button to make text dumps of all stashes and characters in the current project to a sub directory called <Project Name> Text Dumps or something. To be honest, text dumps is the one thing that stops me deleting ATMA and going 100% GoMule.
