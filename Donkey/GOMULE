@Grisu

A nice feature would be if you could choose items from a stash and just dump them on a character at once. Background: It's tiresome to click at every single free space when filling up your inventory in order to cube Flawless gems and then afterwards have to pick up every single PGem. I don't know if this is possible, but - who knows? Well, you probably for instance.
Another idea for picking up all those cubed PGems on your character would be to implement sth like a "hold left mouse button down and move mouse to create a rectangle that selects everything in its area" feature. I'm sure there is an English word for that, but I don't know it
Thanks for all your efforts, silo! It's really appreciated!
EDIT: seperate bank account for every character? Or does GoMule do that already? Well, at least not my version...*looks if version is up to date*
I'll be looking into auto filling characters and stashes. Most likely you'll have to transfer to the clipboard and then dump onto the char the entire clipboard.
I like the idea of multiple drag selection on a character, but I'm not certain it'll actually be much faster, since the items won't always be concentracted in one area and you can click on each item pretty damn fast already.
Bank accounts are going to be looked at in detail, I don't see the advantage of a separate one for each char vs a grand bank for all chars. Please could you explain?

@NacRuno:

1. A stash dump feature
2. Displaying the total amount of money the bank has (or just tell me where it is since i can't seem to find it)
3. Being able to see visuals of items in the stash (not necessary but though i would say anyway)
4. There is a weapon damage calculator in the german site, it would be great if you can add that to your Stats tab so that we can see how much damage the weapon is doing. You do not need to add the bonus from skills, just the %ed and +dam from items would be enough as the calculator does.
5. And since you asked for crazy ideas , it would be great if gomule had a planner tab in which we can assign the remaining stats/skills of a character only to see the results. For example you have a clvl80 char which has done all quests upto Hell Act3, you would allow allocation of 19 + 2 (from last quest) skills and 19*5 + 5 (from act 3 quest) stats and enable us to see the outcome. What would make this different from a simple char planner is that you can also add the stats of the items the char is wearing to display the final statistics. The final statistics would include things from skill damage to hp/mana/AR/block (things you show under Stats tab). I thought since you calculate these things for the character anyway it should't be much of a trouble to recalculate these for other skills/stats/levels. You are to know if i am talking nonsense. =)

New idea: Maybe a rating system where we can give from one to five stars to each item. When i find a very good rare item i say wow and put it in my rares stash. I rarely take them out of the stash as they get mixed with less usuful junk of rares.

1) Should be there in the new version.
2) It's on the clipboard display. But the bank UI will be improved
3) Visuals in the stash would be nice, I agree, but is very low on my list :P I'll see how it fits in when I get the new GUI up and running.
4) Weapon damage is already present in a simple form, ED and +Dam is added to the damage value on the display of the item. I wouldn't mind adding some calc information to GoMule though, I'll see how complex it is.
5) Character planner is something interesting that I've always been tempted to make. If I do make it, it'll be a separate application though, as adding it to GoMule will just make GoMule use more and more memory. If I do make a seperate app, it will be able to read from character d2s files (using GoMule).
6) (Rating system): Interesting idea, but I think it will be pretty underused. Again, if the GUI has space for it, I'll think about it.

@Lionheartthebrave:

Search functions are very expensive on processing and memory. I'll look into it.

@Antonio:

GUI will be redesigned.

One more tip from me: program the double click on the item in the stash window to pick the ite

I like it.

@Pijus:

Clipboard will be upgraded.
Folders are not necessary, when you use the project system. It's badly implemented at the moment, but it will be improved.

@Naab:

NOURZ

@Thyiad:


From my point of view, I have no interest in integrated tools; I'd rather use standalone Flavie, probably because of the complexity of my stashes.

However, one integrated tool I would like would be a text character dump similar to the one ATMA has. I swap gear a fair amount and it would be nice to be able to have an easy to get print out of what character xxxx should be wearing. With fingerprints. So I can quickly find out what they were wearing for a rapid re-equip without me having to go and look up all the breakpoints. I'm lazy. Oh and it could be attached to a NOTES section of the character. Sort of an inbuilt Wordpad. "Xxxxx gear, you were following yyyy guide, don't put points in life, its supposed to be base vita."


The other big issue for me is rares. The search you implimented is great. I absolutely commend it. BUT I want it bigger and better. I have no idea how you would impliment it but at the moment I have stashes for:
Quad resist
Tri resist
Dual Resist
FHR
FRW
FCR

So .... Fcr ring with poison length reduction, light and fire resist would be ...

Yeah.



When I'm trying to prune the various sets/uniques, it would be nice to be able to pick the 'least' or 'most' perfect. There is an Excel % perfect grail sheet so could that be incorporated as a separate search paramater?

So either search by Fire Resist 21 minimum OR > 78% perfect.



I also greatly dislike integrated tools, as you can see from the Drop Calc. Although there is a button which launches it in GoMule, it is an entirely seperate entity, sharing only utility classes to read txt files. I believe that software should have as simple a purpose as possible, to minimise bloat. As such, it is my plan to disconnect Flavie from GoMule entirely. It will be similar to the dropcalc, there will be a button which pipes information across, but spawns it as a seperate entity. This should reduce the memory footprint of GoMule (I hope!!!).

There is already a character dump function under the "dump" tab. Explain more! The biggest problem with the rest of what you're asking for is storage of information. The notes section you propose could not be attached to the D2S file (or it would break it!), so it would need to be stored and tracked in a seperate file. That is more of a pain in the *** for me to do than for you to do with notepad itself.

See my previous response - Searching is one of the most difficult things to do in computing, in terms of memory and processing power. When I look at the search, I'll play around and see if I can hook something up. The current search is pretty GG though.

Least and most perfect....urgh. You remember how that ended up when I implemented it? It's pretty messy, I'll see how the new implementation works out. As for tacking it on to the search, again, I'll look into it when I do the search + perfect code.


@purplelocust:

How about getting it to work with Classic characters? (Not seriously- there is probably at most one person who cares and effort would be far better spent elsewhere.)

I suggest the reverse of Grisu's "auto-equip"- how about an "auto-dump" which would probably be easier to implement? Take all the items from the stash and move them to the clipboard. Good after a series of MF runs, for example.

In the direction of Grisu's cubing simplification: how about a button to dump selected items into the cube, if present? Highlight 3 perfect gems and a charm and click on "sent to the cube?" Just an idea, not sure how useful that would be.

Thyiad's first suggestion could be addressed with a text comment box attached to each project. It would be good to have a spot for tourney notes or notes to oneself: "need to go back and do NM Radament" for example.

I don't know if people take full advantage of the project structure- it's really a great way of doing things. You can have multiple projects pointing to the same stashes and characters in nice ways and I'm grateful that it's set up so well as it is.

Thyad's third suggestion is trickier- the "perfectness" score used in the spreadsheet is quite flawed when it comes to actual utility. That is, a Valkerie Wing with 297 defense, +1 ama skill and +4 mana per kill gets a perfection score of 75% but a Valkerie Wing with 247 defense, +2 ama skill and +2 mana per kill gets a perfection score of 25%. Most people would obviously prefer the less "perfect" one. Nevertheless, it would be great to have something in this direction. But perhaps something similar to perfection- "utility?" would be useful.

How about some kind of searching for staffmods? I know I have a 2 open socket +3 Taunt barb helm somewhere but I have no idea where, for example. (Actually, I think it might be in a 1.07 stash somewhere so GoMule would never find it, but you get the idea!)

Similar to the staffmods, it might be good to search for biggest bonus to a skill including skilltab, class skill and all skill bonues. An Echoing +2 BO helm gives +5 BO, better than a Slayer's +3 BO helm giving +4 to BO.

There may be a way of doing this presently, but one thing that I haven't figured out is how to tell which stash an item in the "all" view is in (for a project with a lot of stashes and characters.) That is, I see it in the all list and I can select it, but I have no idea where it came from- am I grabbing it off a character or grabbing it from a stash?

Is there an easy way of finding upgraded uniques? I sort them by name and then look for the higher str requirement to see if I can find them, but that seems a little clumsy. Perhaps being able to sort for personalized items or upgraded items would be nice as well.

The searching features are currently motivated towards items. Perhaps it would be good to search across characters- by completed quests, or skill levels, or something there. ("Search my HC characters to see if everyone has completed Radament in normal.") Just an idea, probably not that useful.


Urgggh. No classic! One day I'd like to, but it's not near the top of my list.

You can currently take all the items from a stash, do you mean take all the items from a character? That will probably be implemented.

Dumping items into the cube - I like that one. I'll look into it.

Read Thyiads response. It might be present, I'll look into it.

Haha, I didn't even know about the project structure until a few months of using GoMule. The GUI will be designed to use the project idea better.

Yeah, the perfection thing needs a lot of thought. I will think about it!

Staffmods? Sounds good, I can look into that.

Difficult - That falls into the "perfect" side of things, I'll look at it.

There is no mark on where it's coming from - That will be added

There is no specific way, but +Level Req only appears on upped items, so you can search on that.

Searching is already hard enough I'll think about it.


@Smips:

In Atma, the stashes would organize themselves according to what folder they were in, which I quite liked. This way, it's easy to separate socket fillers and untwinked character stashes from uniques.

The project layout removes the need to think of folders/etc. I might include dividers - You'll understand when you see it.

@Max:


A few carry overs from the current GoMule release:
- I would like to see Facets counted properly by Flavie, it would be great if it could count facets that are socketed in gear too.

- I like text dumps, they are very useful for trading, reviewing offline etc. So text dumps for stashes too please. And a button to make text dumps of all stashes and characters in the current project to a sub directory called <Project Name> Text Dumps or something. To be honest, text dumps is the one thing that stops me deleting ATMA and going 100% GoMule.

- Projects are fantastic. I have a PvP Project, Projects for MFOs etc. Switching between them is a bit clunky though and I have trouble with the interface that names the Flavie reports for individual projects. A great feature though.

For the new version:
This idea is a bit half formed and I'm not sure how it will work in practice. But, when I did my design degree, we were always taught to start with the problem, not the solution. So....

Most of my characters get equipped, played and stay in the same gear throughout their life, never having it removed once they make Mat / Pat. Some MF characters and PvP characters are the exception to that. If I play PvP I may have one set of gear for Fire Sorcs, another for Smiters, yet another for Templar's etc. etc., as well as a set of gear for levelling. Similarly my Blizzsorc may have a different set of gear for Tunnels, Meph, Pindle etc.

What I want to do is to be able to quickly change between setups. For example I select my my MF blizzsorc, Stormbringer. I create a profile for called "Pindle." I gear her up and then save the profile. I then create another profile called "Tunnels." I can now auto swap between gear by selecting a profile and pressing a "Equip" button. If the gear is in use by another character you could have an option to stop or auto strip from the other character.


A multiple line filter would be great - perhaps just expand it so that it can have a second or third filter box that you can link with AND / OR statement. EG.
- 10% faster cast AND mana stolen OR life stolen
- mana stole AND life stolen AND >100 AR

I also like Thy's idea of notes. I would like to be able to add forum tags to the default character text dump template to save me cutting and pasting when I make Mat & Pat Threads.


I plan to do facets properly

Text dumps will be there. I like the project idea.

Interface needs some serious work, it'll be sorted. You'll be able to flave whole projects, multiple projects or individual characters.

I like the idea a lot, very nice indeed. Again, it'll need tracking of characters which is a right pain in the ***. But I agree, that would be a very nice feature.

See previous response about searches.

Damn you guys and your notes!For the dump do you mean BBcode? So like instead of "charactername" it looks like <b>charactername</b> (with square brackets)?




Thanks for the suggestions all, some great features and stuff there. I'll keep working slowly though, improving the code as I go along.
