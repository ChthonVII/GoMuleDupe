This release of GoMule is in test stadium, 
do not use this program without backup your D2 characters !!!

Basically the read/write character "core" is setup by Gohanman,
a lot is changed starting from this first release

What it can do:
- opening / saving characters (including moving gold)
- opening / saving / creating ATMA stashes
- autosave with closing characters / stashes / application (allways)
- autobackup with complete history (grouped by day, week or month)
- moving items from one character / stash to another
- Creating Flavie style reports
- open a all item view (all items of project!)
- (almost?) complete item info

- project oriented working, for each project:
	- choice for SC/HC
	- seperate bank/clipboard
	- seperate list of stashes/characters
	- seperate flavie report

How to move an item:
- it is NOT Drag & Drop style like atma !!!

- Open one (or multiple) characters
- move the mouse cursor to an item. (NOTE: the cursur be a hand cursor)
- click the item you want (or multiple) to move (press and release mouse button 1)
-    the to be moving item(s) appears in the "current item" window
-    the item should be removed from the oriniginal spot
-    the orininigal file get's a * in the title (modified)
- move the mouse cursor the new/drop spot. (NOTE: the cursur should be a crosshair cursor)
- click on the position where you want to move the item to
-    the item should be removed from the clipboard to the new spot. 
-    the new file get's a * (modified)
- Click the SaveAll button or just close the application to save the changes.
- The clipboard is also implemented as a stash and is saved with the saveAll / closing application

Note for the "All Item View":
- the clipboard is not included
- A file is only in memory once, if you open a specific char and the "all item view" the character is only read once. (both views point to the same character.) That means if you close and open the character without closing the all items view, the character is not readagain as it's still in memory. (if you play the game while leaving gomule open, close the all item view)
