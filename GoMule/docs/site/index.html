        <h1>
            What is included in GoMule?
        </h1>
        <p>
            GoMule contains three separate applications:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>GoMule</li>
            <li>Flavie</li>
            <li>DropCalc</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>
            Which Version Should I Download?
        </h1>
        <p>GoMule does not move characters between Diablo 2 and Diablo 2 Resurrected, so if you're playing D2
            Resurrected please download the D2 Resurrected version and vice versa. The Diablo 2 version will not open
            resurrected files and stashes and the Resurrected version will not open the older Diablo 2 files and
            stashes.</p>
        <h1>
            What is GoMule?
        </h1>
        <p>This is a muling application for the computer game "Diablo 2" which
            allows items to be stored and transferred between Single Player
            characters outside of the game. The goals of GoMule are to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Easily transfer items between Diablo 2 character files (d2s files)</li>
            <li>Give infinite storage capabilities of both items and gold through the use of stashes (d2x files)</li>
            <li>Allow users to easily locate and sort items in their stashes</li>
            <li>Speed up common muling processes, through multiple pickup and drops</li>
            <li>Allow Unix systems to easily mule their items</li>
        </ul>
        Although GoMule does edit the Diablo 2 game files, it cannot be
        considered a character or item 'editor'. There are very strict
        restrictions on what you can edit, GoMule will never support stat,
        skill or item property editing.
        <p><b>Note: GoMule has problems with the default "Program Files" Directory of new windows versions (Vista,
            Windows 7, Windows 8). The easy solution is NOT to install GoMule and Diablo 2 in this directory.</b></p>
        <p></p>
        <h1>
            What is Flavie?
        </h1>
        <p>Flavie is a report generator for Diablo 2 character files. It
            allows a user to show others what items they have in an easy to read
            format. Here is an example of a report: <a href="http://gomule.sourceforge.net/GoMuleReport.html">Report
                example</a>
        </p>
        <h1>
            What is DropCalc?
        </h1>
        <p>
            The DropCalc or Drop Calculator allows a user to see what their chances
            of finding an item in Diablo 2 is. This allows players to see which
            enemies they should concentrate their efforts on, to ensure that they
            are using their time wisely. </p>
        <p>
            <b>New! </b>Online DropCalc is available at <a href="http://dropcalc.silospen.com/">http://dropcalc.silospen.com/</a>,
            so you don't need to download any software.</p>
