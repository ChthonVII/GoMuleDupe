1) My tals sorceress was showing some pretty horrible resists in
GoMule. But she had two maxed in game. Do we have a maths problem?

I ran the drop calculator to see what the drop chances would be for a SOJ in NM from a boss type monster.  According to the calculator, the best chance is Griswold (see attached).  I was under the impression that quest drop Andy had the best probability to drop.  No?

Silo, I've got a feature request for you: sort by iLvl. 

- Nice to see the facets working. I'm so used to subtracting seven from my items left scores I need to break the habit of doing it automatically. Is there any way Flavie can count socketed facets too though?



DONE:

@silos: I know this is a very trivial thing but, is it possible to display if cow king is killed with a char :hide: This has been the only reason i use ATMA lately.
1) The Character display is missing its background.  (should be fixed?) (Now it is almost certainly fixed).
Silo: Bug report for you. On the drop calc menu, when I switch Type from Atomic TC to Item, and then repeatedly choose Item from the same drop-down, the right-most column seems to be expanding.
Just found a possible GoMule bug:
I have a stash that contains a bunch of twinking gear(a mix of sets, uniques, and socketed items). When I try to pick up a Gemmed Hunter's Bow, I cannot see the stats, it isn't removed from the stash, and I can pick it up as much as I want. Also, if I click on it, it does not become highlighted(I can still pick it up though). Any thoughts?

2) I set up a project for my sept (and all SC Vanilla toons) with no
problems, then tried to set up a project for miscellaneous Modded toons. No
problem. But when I tried to import the 'tourney toons' (as I call them) I
got an error (see below) and only one of the characters loaded. Now things
appear to be stuck in the Tourney project: I can't open OrangeJuice (HC Mod)
and can't load RangerRick (SC Mod).
(projname)
- When I do a full dump of a project, is it possible to include the character stats and skills in the text files, and not just the items? It would be nice if the file generated by the dump project button was the same as the dump tab on the character window.
Fixed dump skills being incorrectly ordered
- My left (RIGHT???) hand side bar always comes in too large - the boxes align side by side. When I re-size it the align nicely underneath eachother, but the size isn't saved in any way. I can do a screenshot later if I'm not being clear.
Fixed dropcalc for council member minions - problem was quality list not being included.
Attemped to optimise on txt file reading. GoMule now reads when files are required rather than initially.
FIX BOSS AND SU with SOJ. <- Possibly fixed.
Fixed dropcalc for council member minions AGAIN. boss fix broke previous fix.
Fixed +Max damage on some items
Fixed items not consolidating together on misc items



GOMULE

Major rewrite of the item property classes. They now:
-use the diablo game files more.
-applies transformations to items correctly and cleanly.
-does things in an appropriate class rather than the item class.
-fixed numerous display bugs.


Added to the main GUI
-Added new functionality
-Double click on items to remove from stash!
-Improved error handling
-Added more user friendly messages

Partially refactored a large number of classes.

Fixed so many bugs I can't remember most of them:
-Fixed level reqs for set items
-Fixed level reqs for rare items
-Fixed backup dates
-Fixed problem where certain file parameters could lead to crash on character load
-Fixed rare items being classed as crafted
-Fixed item filter on stash (so many damn times. Regex....)
-Fixed GUID problems with charms
-Fixed multiple problems with MACS (DAMN YOU MAC USERS!)
-Fixed problems with some runewords


DROPCALC

Fixed bug with multiple items in a single type (eg tyraels + templars)
Fixed bugs with MF (diminishing returns not correct, rounding errors everywhere!)
Fixed problems with certain monsters and their TCs
Fixed various bugs leading to errors
Added new kills column thanks to the help of the community (Oscuro for the patch, RTB for the original idea and Anaesthesia for the math)


FLAVIE

Fixed the damn rainbow facet in flavie bug!!!!!!


...And much more that I've forgotten.


One thing I noticed in text dumps of Donkey was there are several line breaks sometimes not just one. See attached.
>FIXED APART FROM SET ITEMS;

When you pick something up to the clipboard and move the cursor over to the drop all window the popup/mouse over info comes up instantly. This obscures the drop button. The one which should be on the stash window. *cough*
Anyway, you need to increase the delay or move the buttons down, because it's bloody annoying.

WEAPON DAMAGE FOR 2H storage etc.

- I like text dumps, they are very useful for trading, reviewing offline etc. So text dumps for stashes too please. And a button to make text dumps of all stashes and characters in the current project to a sub directory called <Project Name> Text Dumps or something. To be honest, text dumps is the one thing that stops me deleting ATMA and going 100% GoMule.
